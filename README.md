#Tic-Tac-Toe

![Banner](banner.jpg "Tic-Tac-Toe")

Here is the original tic-tac-toe game! I made it in bash to improve my level
in shell scripts, and because the course was too boring :P! To play this game 
just follow instructions the below.

May the power of banana be with you!


###Use
```
git clone git@github.com:maloblanchard/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe/
bash app.sh
```

###Warning
Single player is not implemented. So you can play alternately Player1 and then 
Player2, or (much better) play with a friend using an instant terminal 
sharing app, like [tmate](http://tmate.io/) ;).


###Thanks
