# Tic-Tac-Toe

![Banner](banner.jpg "Tic-Tac-Toe")

Here is THE original tic-tac-toe game made with love during classroom in order to improve my scripting level.


###Install & Play
```
git clone git@github.com:maloblanchard/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe/
bash play.sh
```

###Warning
Single player is not implemented. So you can play alternately as Player1 and then 
Player2, but I strongly recommand you to play with a friend using an instant terminal 
sharing app, like [tmate](http://tmate.io/) ;).


###Thanks
Many thanks to [Romain Baumier](https://github.com/rbaumier) for it's help.
