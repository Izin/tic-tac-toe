#Tic-Tac-Toe

![Banner](banner.jpg "Tic-Tac-Toe")

Here is the original tic-tac-toe game! I made it in bash to improve my level
in shell scripts, and because the course was too boring :P! To play this game 
just follow instructions below.

Pay attention to the fact that the solo is not implemented. To play with a 
friend, you'll have to use for example [tmate](http://tmate.io/) to share your 
current terminal and enjoy the fun ;).


###Use
```
bash app.sh
```

###Requirements
```
bash 4+ and a banana artifact
```
